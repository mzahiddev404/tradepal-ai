Versioning & Sharing
Learning Objectives
• Understand how version control works for n8n workflows.
• Learn how to save, track, and revert workflow versions
safely.
• Explore methods for sharing workflows within teams or
across environments.
• Gain practical knowledge of collaboration features and
workflow export/import.
• Recognize best practices for maintaining workflow
consistency and reducing errors.
Description
Why Versioning Matters
Versioning in n8n allows you to keep track of changes
made to workflows over time. Each version captures the
workflow’s structure, nodes, and connections, enabling
you to revert to a previous state if errors or issues arise.
Key benefits of versioning include:
• Error Recovery: Restore a previous workflow version if a
recent change breaks execution.
• Change Tracking: Understand what modifications were
made, when, and by whom.
• Experimentation: Safely test new logic or nodes without
aﬀecting production workflows.
• Auditability: Maintain a record of workflow evolution for
compliance or documentation purposes.
Versioning is essential for both individual developers and
collaborative teams managing multiple workflows
simultaneously.
Creating and Managing Workflow Versions
n8n allows you to manage workflow versions easily
through its interface:
• Active vs Draft Versions: Keep an active version running
while creating draft updates.
• Manual Versioning: Save snapshots of a workflow at key
stages, labeling them for easy identification.
• Automatic Backups: Some setups support automatic
backups of workflows, providing an extra layer of safety.
• Reverting Versions: Restore a previous version quickly if
new changes cause errors or unintended behavior.
This structured approach ensures workflows remain
stable while allowing iterative improvement.
Sharing Workflows
n8n workflows can be shared between users, teams, or
environments without exposing sensitive data:
• Export/Import: Workflows can be exported as JSON files
and imported into another n8n instance. This is ideal for
migrating workflows between development, staging, and
production.
• Credential Separation: Credentials are not included in
exported workflows, ensuring sensitive information remains
secure. Shared workflows can be configured with
environment-specific credentials.
• Team Collaboration: Multiple users can collaborate on
workflows in a shared environment, reviewing changes
before activating new versions.
• Workflow Templates: Create reusable templates for common
tasks or organizational standards, speeding up onboarding
and workflow creation.
Sharing workflows eﬃciently encourages reuse,
consistency, and collaboration across teams.
Best Practices for Versioning and Sharing
• Label Versions Clearly: Use descriptive version names or
numbers to easily identify workflow changes.
• Test Draft Versions: Always validate a draft workflow before
activating it in production.
• Maintain a Change Log: Keep a brief note of what was
changed, why, and by whom for each version.
• Use Templates for Reuse: Standardize workflows for
common tasks and share them as templates to ensure
consistency.
• Separate Environments: Use development, staging, and
production instances to test workflows safely before
deployment.
Implementing these practices reduces errors, simplifies
collaboration, and ensures that workflows evolve in a
controlled and reliable manner.
Real-World Applications
• Team Collaboration: Multiple developers working on
automation projects can track changes and avoid conflicts.
• Migration Across Environments: Move workflows from
development to production without manually recreating
nodes or connections.
• Experimentation and Rollback: Test new automation logic
safely, with the ability to revert if something breaks.
• Knowledge Sharing: Distribute workflow templates within
the organization to standardize processes.
• Audit and Compliance: Maintain versioned records of
workflows for regulatory or internal audit purposes.
Versioning and sharing ensure workflows remain robust,
maintainable, and scalable in collaborative or enterprise
environments.
Analogy
Versioning and sharing in n8n is like managing drafts of a
collaborative document in a team. Each draft saves
changes made by diﬀerent people, allowing anyone to
revert to an earlier version if needed. Sharing workflows is
similar to exporting that document to another team
member without sharing personal notes (credentials),
ensuring the core content is usable while keeping
sensitive information private.
Key Points
• Versioning tracks workflow changes and allows rollback if
errors occur.
• Active and draft workflow versions enable safe updates
without disrupting live workflows.
• Manual or automatic versioning provides snapshots and
backup options.
• Workflows can be exported/imported as JSON files for
sharing or migration.
• Credentials are excluded in exports to maintain security.
• Workflow templates support reuse and standardization
across teams.
• Clear version labeling and change logs improve
maintainability.
• Separate environments for dev, staging, and production
enhance testing and reliability.
• Sharing workflows encourages collaboration, consistency,
and knowledge transfer.
Instructions
Now that you have learned these things, now try doing
something like this:
1. Create a new workflow – Design a workflow and save
it as the first version.
2. Make changes – Add new nodes or modify logic and
save as a draft or new version.
3. Compare versions – Review the diﬀerences between
the active version and your draft.
4. Revert if needed – Restore an earlier version to test
rollback functionality.
5. Export the workflow – Save it as a JSON file to share
with another n8n instance.
6. Import and test – Import the workflow in a diﬀerent
instance and verify it functions correctly using
environment-specific credentials.
