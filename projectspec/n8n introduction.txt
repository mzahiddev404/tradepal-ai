n8n Introduction
Learning Objectives
• Understand what n8n is and its role in workflow automation
and integration.
• Learn the core concepts of nodes, triggers, and workflows.
• Explore how n8n connects diﬀerent applications, APIs, and
services.
• Recognize the flexibility and extensibility of n8n for custom
automation.
• Gain practical insights on how to start building simple
automated workflows.
Description
What is n8n?
n8n (pronounced “n-eight-n”) is an open-source workflow
automation tool designed to connect diﬀerent services,
APIs, and applications. Unlike traditional integration
platforms, n8n provides a fair-code license, giving
developers full access to customize and host their
workflows. It allows users to automate repetitive tasks,
synchronize data across systems, and create multi-step
processes without writing extensive code.
At its core, n8n functions as an orchestration platform
where each workflow consists of a series of nodes. Each
node performs a specific action, such as fetching data
from an API, sending an email, or transforming data. The
workflows are visually designed but flexible enough to
incorporate advanced logic, loops, and conditional
operations.
Key Concepts: Workflows, Nodes, and
Triggers
• Workflow: A container for a series of automated actions.
Think of it as a blueprint that defines the sequence and
dependencies between diﬀerent tasks.
• Node: A single unit of action within a workflow. Nodes can
interact with applications, APIs, databases, or perform
operations on data.
• Trigger: A special type of node that initiates a workflow.
Triggers can be event-based (like receiving an email),
schedule-based (like running every hour), or manual.
These components work together to create end-to-end
automation pipelines that can execute tasks across
multiple systems reliably and eﬃciently.
Advantages of Using n8n
n8n provides several benefits compared to traditional
coding approaches or other automation tools:
• Visual Workflow Builder: Drag-and-drop interface reduces
complexity while allowing advanced logic.
• Open Source: Full access to the underlying code allows
customization and self-hosting.
• Extensive Integrations: Hundreds of pre-built nodes for
common applications, databases, and APIs.
• Flexibility: Supports JavaScript code execution for custom
transformations and logic.
• Scalable: Workflows can be simple automations or complex
multi-step integrations.
• Transparent Versioning: Track changes, updates, and
collaborate on workflow development.
These features make n8n suitable for small automation
tasks as well as enterprise-level orchestration.
Real-World Use Cases
• Data Synchronization: Automatically transfer data between
CRM, ERP, and databases.
• Marketing Automation: Trigger emails, update spreadsheets,
or post on social media based on events.
• IT Operations: Monitor servers, collect logs, and trigger
notifications when issues occur.
• Reporting: Aggregate data from multiple sources into
dashboards or spreadsheets automatically.
• AI-Enhanced Workflows: Integrate AI nodes to process
content, analyze sentiment, or generate text summaries.
n8n’s versatility allows it to act as a central hub for
automating both internal operations and external
integrations.
Analogy
Think of n8n like a smart conveyor belt system in a
factory. Each station (node) performs a specific task,
whether it’s assembling, inspecting, or packaging. The
belt (workflow) ensures that items move through each
station in the correct order, triggered automatically by
sensors (triggers) when new materials arrive. This ensures
eﬃciency, accuracy, and the ability to scale operations
without manually handling every step.
Key Points
• n8n is an open-source workflow automation and integration
platform.
• Workflows are sequences of nodes connected logically to
perform tasks.
• Triggers initiate workflows, either based on events,
schedules, or manually.
• Nodes can interact with APIs, databases, files, or perform
custom operations.
• Visual drag-and-drop interface makes automation
accessible without heavy coding.
• Supports JavaScript for advanced transformations and
logic.
• Can handle simple automations or complex multi-step
processes.
• Open-source nature allows self-hosting, customization, and
transparency.
• Real-world applications include data sync, marketing, IT
monitoring, reporting, and AI-powered workflows.
Instructions
Now that you have learned these things, now try doing
something like this:
1. Explore the n8n interface – Open the n8n dashboard
and familiarize yourself with nodes, workflows, and
triggers.
2. Create a simple workflow – Start with a basic
workflow like sending a notification when a new email
arrives.
3. Add nodes – Connect nodes for reading data,
transforming it, and sending output.
4. Test the workflow – Trigger the workflow manually or
using an event to see it in action.
5. Experiment with integrations – Add another node for
a diﬀerent service (e.g., Google Sheets or Slack) to
see data flow across systems.
6. Save and review – Check the workflow execution
logs and outputs to understand the process and
debug if necessary.
