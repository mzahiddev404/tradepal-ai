Credential Vault
Learning Objectives
• Understand the purpose and functionality of the Credential
Vault in n8n.
• Learn how to securely store and manage API keys, tokens,
and other sensitive data.
• Explore how credentials integrate with nodes to simplify
workflow design.
• Gain practical knowledge to create, reuse, and maintain
credentials safely.
• Recognize best practices for security, versioning, and
sharing of credentials.
Description
What is the Credential Vault?
The Credential Vault in n8n is a secure storage system for
sensitive information such as API keys, OAuth tokens,
usernames, passwords, and other secrets. Instead of
hardcoding these values directly into workflows—which
poses security risks—n8n allows users to store them in a
central vault.
Credentials are referenced by nodes during workflow
execution, meaning you never expose secrets in plain text
in your workflow design. This separation of sensitive data
and workflow logic improves both security and
maintainability.
Creating and Managing Credentials
Adding a credential to the vault involves specifying the
credential type (like Google API, Slack, or HTTP Request)
and entering required authentication details. Once saved,
credentials can be reused across multiple workflows,
reducing duplication and errors.
Key features include:
• Reusable Credentials: Reference the same credential across
multiple workflows.
• Credential Types: n8n supports built-in credential types for
many services, and you can create custom credentials if
needed.
• Encryption: Credentials are encrypted in storage and
decrypted only during workflow execution.
• Versioning: Updates to credentials are tracked, ensuring
workflows always use current secrets without exposing
older versions.
Integrating Credentials into Workflows
Using credentials in workflows is straightforward:
• When configuring a node that requires authentication, select
the stored credential from a dropdown list.
• Nodes automatically use the credential during execution,
without revealing sensitive values in logs or workflow
definitions.
• Changes to a credential automatically propagate to all
workflows using it, simplifying maintenance.
This approach allows teams to maintain secure and
consistent access across multiple workflows and
environments.
Best Practices for Credential Vault Usage
• Avoid Hardcoding: Never enter secrets directly into nodes or
scripts; always use the vault.
• Environment Separation: Maintain diﬀerent credentials for
development, staging, and production.
• Access Control: Limit who can create, view, or modify
credentials to reduce security risks.
• Regular Updates: Rotate API keys and tokens periodically
for enhanced security.
• Audit Usage: Monitor which workflows are using which
credentials to maintain visibility and accountability.
Adhering to these practices reduces the risk of accidental
exposure or misuse of sensitive information.
Real-World Applications
• API Integrations: Store API keys for services like Google
Sheets, Slack, or AWS securely.
• Database Connections: Keep usernames and passwords for
databases encrypted and reusable.
• OAuth Tokens: Manage authentication for services requiring
OAuth without exposing tokens in workflows.
• Third-Party Services: Securely manage credentials for
CRMs, marketing platforms, or internal APIs.
• Team Collaboration: Share workflows without revealing
sensitive secrets, as credentials remain encrypted in the
vault.
The Credential Vault ensures that n8n workflows can
interact with external systems safely while maintaining
operational eﬃciency.
Analogy
Think of the Credential Vault as a locked safe in an oﬃce.
Instead of writing passwords on sticky notes or keeping
keys under the desk, all sensitive information is securely
stored in the safe. Employees (workflow nodes) can
access what they need during their tasks, but the safe
prevents unauthorized access and keeps all secrets
encrypted. This ensures security without disrupting daily
operations.
Key Points
• Credential Vault stores sensitive information like API keys,
passwords, and tokens securely.
• Credentials are encrypted and only accessed during
workflow execution.
• Supports built-in and custom credential types for multiple
services.
• Enables reuse of credentials across workflows, reducing
duplication and errors.
• Integrates seamlessly with nodes, allowing automatic
authentication.
• Supports environment separation and access control for
security.
• Updates propagate automatically to all workflows using the
credential.
• Best practices include avoiding hardcoding, rotating keys,
and auditing usage.
• Enhances team collaboration by keeping workflows
functional without exposing secrets.
Instructions
Now that you have learned these things, now try doing
something like this:
1. Access the Credential Vault – Open the credentials
section in the n8n dashboard.
2. Create a new credential – Choose a built-in service
type (e.g., Google Sheets) and enter the required
authentication details.
3. Test the credential – Use the “Test” option to confirm
it works correctly.
4. Apply the credential to a node – Add a node that
requires authentication and select the stored
credential from the dropdown.
5. Reuse the credential – Add the same credential to
another workflow to observe automatic integration.
6. Update and audit – Modify a credential value and
check how changes propagate to workflows using it.
